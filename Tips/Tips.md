	Sort array of Arrays [[1,2],[2,3]] ======>	
    Arrays.sort((a,b) => b[0] - a[0])
	
    If diffrence b/w is given and such numbers to be found in array. ====>	
    Use map . Key as number and freq. as value .Traverse and put condition map[key - diff]
	
    if node to be removed from end of list 	Start one pointer till n. And start one more pointer till first reach the last. Now remove next element of second pointer.

	If asking to form valid combinations of two somethinngs eg. brackets ====>
    Use recursion and one call add one side and other call add other side. Increase pointers for length of possible combos ref. https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/
